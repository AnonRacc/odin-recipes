    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <l1>1 medium onion, diced</l1>
        <l1>1 clove garlic, minced</l1>
        <l1>1 tablespoon chili powder</l1>
        <l1>1 teaspoon ground cumin</l1>
        <l1>½ teaspoon paprika</l1>
        <l1>½ teaspoon salt</l1>
        <l1>½ teaspoon black pepper</l1>
        <l1>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</l1>
        <l1>4 (10 inch) flour tortillas</l1>
        <l1>½ cup salsa</l1>
        <l1>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</l1>
        <l1>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</l1>
        <l1>2 green onions, chopped</l1>
        <l1>2 tomatoes, diced</l1>
        <l1>¼ cup thinly sliced jalapeño pepper</l1>
        <l1>¼ cup sour cream (Optional)</l1>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <l1>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <l1>Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is evenly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <l1>Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned ground beef over each one, and then cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas are crisp, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <l1>Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread 1/2 of the salsa over each top tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.</li>
        <l1>Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Let pizzas cool slightly before slicing each one into 4 pieces. </li>
    </ol>
